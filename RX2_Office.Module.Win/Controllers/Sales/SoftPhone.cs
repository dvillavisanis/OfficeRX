        /*
         To send our voice through the microphone to the other client's speaker, we need to connect them.
         We send our voice through the mediaSender, and we get the other client's voice through the mediaSender to our speaker object. 
          
         To disconnect these handlers, we will use the DisconnectMedia() method.
		           
         It is possible to use other mediahandlers with the connector, for example we can connect a WaveStreamPlayback or an MP3StreamPlayback object to the MediaSender, so we can play music/voice
         during the call. For exmaple: when can create an IVR (Interactive Voice Response), we can create voice recorder etc.
         
         For example:
         We can connect an .mp3 file player (which plays an mp3 file into the voice call) by the "connector.Connect(Mp3StreamPlayback, mediaSender);  " line.
         (We should also create an MP3StreamPlayback object: "MP3StreamPlayback Mp3StreamPlayback; "
         and we need to tell to this object the details (what to play into the speaker, etc.))
